## What is AppTycoon

AppTycoon is a management / idle game for Android about managing a software company. This a personal project of mine born out of interest towards the idle game genre. AppTycoon is about mixing the idleness (i.e. the "game playing itself for you") with the management aspect by letting the player tinker and tune the company and be in control of the operations.

This project is also a sort of a tryout on how the plain Android API and a UI build with "native" Android components and mechanics work for a game.


## Development

This is a hobby project which I originally intended to publish only after it was in a somewhat playable state. This plan obviously changed as I decided to make the development public at this early stage.

I work on this project on my free-time, so there is no schedule or road map of when and what will be done. 


## Features

See the files under the /doc folder. There is a file called game-description.md which is a very high level description of the features of the game. That document should be an up to date reflection of what plans I have for the game and also what is already implemented.

## Screenshots

Screenshots will follow soon!

Meanwhile, take a peek at what the style of the game will be like at [youtu.be/AVLkh5k8LeA](https://youtu.be/AVLkh5k8LeA).
